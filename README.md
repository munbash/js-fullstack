# JavaScript Fullstack Practice Projects
This repository contains my practice while learning JavaScript through **The Odin Project** through self study.

Each folder demonstrates different concepts such as:
- Functions,
- Objects
- Constructors
- DOM Manipulation

Each folder contains:
- **Index.html**
- **Css**
- **Readme.md**
- **script.js**
